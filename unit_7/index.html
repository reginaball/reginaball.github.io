		<h2>Client Testimonials</h2>

			<p>"Regina turned my rough ideas and sketches into the perfect logo for watermarking my photography!  She was a pleasure to work with; I could not have asked for a better result."</p>
			<cite>Marty McKee Photography</cite>

		<blockquote class="testimonial-quote">
			<img src="images/brand-circles.png" alt="client logo" title="client name" class="client-logo">
			<p>"I still can’t believe how easy Regina is to work with. She listened and advised with equal skill, cranked out mock-ups at record speed, humored the back-and- forth between details and minor edits like ear shape, and the timeline… just wow. Coming up with a clean, seal-style logo for cat stuff that hasn’t been done before is a challenge, and she knocked it out of the park."</p>
